# Website\(s\) Communication Strategy

## Intent

Greenpeace.ch is an engagement platform. Its main goal is to empower our current and future supporters to take action, donate to our cause and explore our campaigns.

The website also provides landing pages for specialized audiences like media professionals, job seekers and others.

## Target audiences

The main target audiences are our existing and future supporters. They are a very diversified group of people that we'd like to guide to the topics they are interested in and opportunities to act in a way they are motivated to.

People of the main target audience don't always visit our website with a purpose. We have to be extra careful to guide them towards taking action, but also keep them informed about our campaigns along the way. 

### Landing pages

There are many specialized target groups that usually come our way with a purpose: They are looking for jobs, for press releases or other specialized content. They might also follow a call to action on other channels: newsletter, social media, and so on.

People with a purpose don't usually start by navigating from our home page. They land directly on a page they were linked to or one they found using a search engine. Specialized landing pages enable these target audiences to find their content efficiently.

## Satellite websites

We strive to unify our world wide web presence into a well-arranged website that offers an overview of our campaigns and that guides our supporters to take action together with us. 

To guarantee a good experience interacting with our www presence, we mostly focus on communicating everything we do in our campaigns through our main website greenpeace.ch. However, there are certain exceptions that justify using a different platform on a separate domain \(a satellite to our main website\):

* The project requires working with partners that would not be willing to communicate through a Greenpeace branded website. Examples: Refilldiet.ch
* The use of additional interactive functionality that isn't available through greenpeace.ch. Examples: [https://greenwire.greenpeace.ch/](https://greenwire.greenpeace.ch/)
