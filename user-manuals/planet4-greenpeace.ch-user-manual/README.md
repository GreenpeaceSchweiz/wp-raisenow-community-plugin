# Planet4 greenpeace.ch User Manual

## Overview

Greenpeace.ch is based on [Planet4](https://planet4.greenpeace.org/), which is the global Greenpeace platform for NRO and project websites. It is actively developed by a GPI team.

Planet4 has been modified and extended to match Greenpeace Switzerland's requirements. The most important changes are:

* Different layout that matches more closely with our understanding of the CI and our communication. Includes separate color schemes for our campaigns.
* Petitions and other forms are directly built into the website
* Additional content blocks
* Changed share buttons with more functionality
* Additional content types \(like background articles, events\)
* A separate Google Analytics setup

## Help, how do I? I found a bug!

Get in contact either through the Slack channels \(see below\) or by contacting Stefan or Christoph directly.
